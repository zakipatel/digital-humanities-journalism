# digital-humanities-journalism
We are collecting what digital humanities and news nerds want to explore together (and how we might facilitate it). Please add below or to [issues](https://github.com/livlab/digital-humanities-journalism/issues)

This discussion started with Joe Germuska: 
**"Seems like some kind of meeting of the tribes between news nerds and digital humanities folks would pay off nicely."**

## Projects and Examples

* [What the Met is doing](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/arts/design/museums-see-different-virtues-in-virtual-worlds.html?_r=1)
* [SHAXICAN Perl scripts](http://gabrielegan.com/shaxican/index.htm) - English professor analyzed word frequency and unusual usage in every one of Shakespeare's plays to try to figure out which characters he most likely played on stage. For example if he played the part of Horatio in Hamlet, more of the words of Horatio's dialogue would appear in the next play Shakespeare wrote -- simply because all of Horatio's lines were so present in his head when he wrote his next play.
* [LOTR Project](http://lotrproject.com/) - this is AMAZING: the lord of the rings in data 
* [What would happen if historians made their research notes public?](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
* [Structured Stories](http://www.structuredstories.com/) - reporting *in* structured data instead of attempting post-publication; running an experiment this summer in NYC to see if it's a viable model for news.
* [Explaain](http://explaain.com/) - Jeremy Evans' new project exploring reporting around issues instead of breaking news events; [journalism.co.uk writeup](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/issues-not-news-how-explaain-wants-to-reinvent-the-article/s2/a565019/)
* [Google Living Stories](http://livingstories.googlelabs.com/) - about 5 years old now but shows one possible presentation of news as connected storylines.
* [The Refugee Project](http://www.therefugeeproject.org/#) - mapping migrations over time with related stories (here, events and headlines)
* [Space Log](http://spacelog.org/) - Read the stories of early space exploration from the original transcripts. Now open to the public in a searchable, linkable format.
* [Ontomedia](http://contextus.net/) and the work of Faith Lawrence & Mike Jewell - the former is in the Digital Humanities faculty at Kings College London, Mike Jewell is at Southampton University, both have been v influential in DH & narrative circles
* [Arab Spring Storyline](http://story-newshack.rhcloud.com/) - from the first [BBC News Labs](http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk) hack - [#16 in the list here](http://newshack.co.uk/newshack-2013/hacks/), an example visualization built on [BBC's Storyline ontology](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/storyline). This is a take on explaining key events in the Arab Spring through a mix of pull quotes, maps, timelines and charts.
* [Stories Ontology](http://contextus.net/stories) - a model (predating BBC Storyline) which is more focused on interpretations of events (i.e. useful for more subjective claims about stuff)
* [Home Front](http://homefront.ch.bbc.co.uk/) - BBC website for a radio program on world war I allows exploration via characters, events, places involved, using storyline ontology.
* [Mythology Engine](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2010/03/the-mythology-engine-represent.shtml) - early project structuring Doctor Who as storylines. Site is up but behind a login - ask @r4isstatic for a login to the site if you're interested.
